Project I completed for Frontend Mentor

I used the Frontend Mentor website to find and replicate this design. 
I learned about how to customize an svg and how to write javascript to 
modify the css visibility styles to hide and make disible on click. 
I'm very happy with my results but I of course welcome any feedback to
that will help make me a better front-end developer! Thanks for visiting my project!
